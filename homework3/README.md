# Homework 3

In this homework I made an app where you can create, read, update and delete records in a database


### Future development ideas

- Currently while editing and creating new records in database you can see the value of a car but it isn't shown in the list view

- Add "cancel" button/link on create/edit/delete views

- **Links to edited files on this project might be added in the future**
